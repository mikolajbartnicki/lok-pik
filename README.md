## Logo spade shape definition

Draw using Inkscape program, on the grid. Lower left point is (0; 0) - the beginning of the Cartesian coordinates system. Vectors defining shape curves start at their points.

| Point number | Point coordinates | Previous point vector | Next point vector |
|:------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1.           | (0; 0)            | none                  | none              |
| 2.           | (0, 12)           | none                  | [-7; 4]           |
| 3.           | (2, 14)           | [1; -6]               | [5; -8]           |
| 4.           | (24, 20)          | [0; -13]              | [0; 13]           |
| 5.           | (0; 48)           | [7; -12]              | none              |

Mirror the shape horizontally, and fill it with black color ```#000000```.
